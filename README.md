# Dolby.io Inter-Uni Hackathon 2023 
## Safe Order 

### Theme
The theme of the hack was to build a solution for social good whilst incorporating Dolby.io API services.

### Idea
We came up with a ReactJS website to help people living in an abusive household to receive emergency help without making it obvious. The website is a decoy food delivery platform, which looks real, but every option they select throughout the user flow creates a code message which gets sent to the emergency operator. The operator can then, pretending to be customer support, call the victim through another decoy call interface which utilized Dolby's communication API, and confirm their assistance.

### Inspiration
Our solution was inspired by an incident where a woman called 911, pretending to order a pizza while actually asking for help, which was fortunately picked up on by the operator.

### Instructions to run the project locally
1. Clone the project using ```HTTPS``` ```SSH```

2. cd into the ```vite-project``` sub-directory

3. run ```npm run build```

4. run ```npm run dev``` to start the server

The website is deployed via Netlify although there are some issues in finding the images and routing correctly so currently the deployed version does not function fully as intended. 

However, the Dolby Audio-Video conferencing app is deployed separately on Netlify and works perfectly 

To view the website workflow as intended, follow the instructions above to clone and run the project 

Will put up a video demo soon!
